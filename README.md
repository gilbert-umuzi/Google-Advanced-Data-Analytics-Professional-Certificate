# Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics-Professional-Certificate

The Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate contains information on how to use machine learning, predictive modeling, and experimental design to collect and analyze large amounts of data, and prepare for jobs like Senior Data Analyst and Junior Data Scientist.

The entire program has seven courses: 

**1. Foundations of Data Science** – This course introduces the fundamentals of data science, how different data professionals operate in the workplace, and how these roles contribute to an organization’s vision of their future. The data science workflow PACE (plan, analyze, construct, enhance) is introduced to help you better understand how to navigate the technical and workplace expectations of this career. 

**2. Getting Started with Python **– In this course, you will get started with Python for data analytics by developing an understanding of Python syntax, logic, data types, objects, and object-oriented programming. 

**3. Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights** – Learn the fundamentals of data cleaning and visualizations and how to uncover meaningful stories in the data.

**4. The Power of Statistics** – Learn descriptive and inferential statistics, basic probability and probability distributions, sampling, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing.

**5. Regression Analysis: Simplifying Complex Data Relationships** – In this course, you will apply your knowledge to modeling variable relationships, with a focus on linear regression, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and logistic regression. From model assumptions to evaluation and interpretation, you will understand relationships in datasets based on PACE. (This is the course you just completed. Well done!)

**6. The Nuts and Bolts of Machine Learning** – This course covers the fundamentals of supervised machine learning, and introduces learners to unsupervised learning through K-means and other clustering models. Learners will use different classification techniques such as decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting to approach a realistic business problem. 

**7. Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone** – This course presents the capstone project for the Advanced Data Analytics certificate, which incorporates key concepts from each of the six preceding courses. The capstone project will yield data-driven suggestions including visualizations and models to provide insight for the business problem.
